Things to be added:
    - Game win condition in board class
        - Check for win at the end of while loop to end game
    -Account for possible errors
        - Player does not input an int or inputs an int out of range
    - UI and graphics
        - Find a library and learn it
    - Levels
        - Have an array or text file that has many different starting positions of varying difficulty.  The player can /
          choose a difficulty and the puzzle name will be displayed.
    - Game flow
        - Welcome to the game, choose difficulty, instructions, etc. Basically want a menu here
    - Build a solver to find the optimal solution every time

Questions:
    - Will the board size always be 5x5?  Should I keep that as a variable parameter.  Easier puzzles could be 3x3 and /
      harder ones can be up to 7x7 or 9x9

Other games to consider:
    - Auto battler
